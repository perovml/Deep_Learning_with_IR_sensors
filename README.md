## üß† Overview

This study introduces a novel approach to leveraging low-power, low-resolution infrared (IR) sensors for detailed multi-person tracking in manufacturing environments. We curated a dataset capturing a wide range of human interactions, annotated for two key tasks:

- **Multiple-person localization**
- **Social distance violation detection**

Our method combines **convolutional** and **recurrent neural networks** to process spatiotemporal data. Key results:

- ‚úÖ **97.5% image-level accuracy** in human localization using a novel segmentation-based approach  
- üìè **91% macro-averaged accuracy** in a 4-class social distance classification task  

This highlights the importance of **interpolation methods** and **convolutional kernel selection** for effective social distance modeling.
