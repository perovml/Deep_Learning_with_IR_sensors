Privacy-Preserving Localization and Social Distance Monitoring with Low-Resolution Thermal Imaging
This repository contains the implementation for the paper:
"Privacy-Preserving Localization and Social Distance Monitoring with Low-Resolution Thermal Imaging and Deep Learning"
by Andrei Perov and Jens Heger
Available at: ScienceDirect

Overview
This study introduces a novel approach to leveraging low-power, low-resolution infrared (IR) sensors for detailed multi-person tracking in manufacturing environments. We curated a dataset capturing a wide range of human interactions, annotated for two key tasks:

Multiple-person localization

Social distance violation detection

Our method combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks to process spatiotemporal data. Notably:

We achieve 97.5% image-level accuracy in human localization using a novel segmentation-based approach.

We reach 91% macro-averaged accuracy in a four-class social distance violation classification task, emphasizing the importance of interpolation and kernel selection in model design.
